## Area: Sensorimotor Functions (Gross Motor and Fine Motor)

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to the area denoted above. For scores that are Below { range }, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are Exceptionally High/Above { range } to Exceptionally Low/Below { range } to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Finally, recommended additional support that the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall Below { range } to Exceptionally Low.

<<EXAMPLE>>

All scores in this area were { range }.
Fine motor speed and dexterity were { range } bilaterally.
No evidence of atypical lateralization of fine nor gross motor skills.
No evidence of dyspraxia.
Graphomotor speed and accuracy (i.e., graphomotor control) was intact.
Gross motor functioning including balance and gait appeared intact on observation.
