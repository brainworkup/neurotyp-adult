# RECOMMENDATIONS

## Medical/Health

- _Stanford Functional Neurological Disorder Program_ treats FND with a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach. More information can be found at <https://med.stanford.edu/psychiatry/patient_care/fnd.html>.
- _La Selva Residential and Day Programs for FND_ A collaboration with Stanford, the FND Day Program is a specialized treatment track within La Selva's state-of-the-art residential, partial hospitalization (PHP) and intensive outpatient programs (IOP). <https://thelaselvagroup.org/fnd-track/>
- Psychiatric medication review with Dr. Frank to focus on antidepressants that address both
mood and somatic symptoms, considering SSRIs or augmentation strategies given
the complex presentation of depression. Also, consult with Dr. Frank regarding
the possible use of a stimulant medication to treat executive functioning difficulties.
- Implement a safety plan with specific strategies for managing suicidal ideation, including emergency contacts and graded coping responses
- Good evidence suggests that new approaches to physiotherapy, which are especially modified to the condition, can be used for the treatment of functional motor disorders.
  - For example, therapy for functional motor disorders builds on differences between automatic and voluntary movement that form the diagnosis and uses these differences in physical therapy.

## Psychosocial

- Outpatient psychotherapy of medium duration (months rather than weeks or years), combining cognitive and behavioral interventions (DBT, CBT) with between-session practice, should be considered to help Max learn ways to better manage his mood and stress levels moving forward.
  - Consider supplemental trauma-informed therapy to explore potential
  connections between past stressors (including the 2020 episode) and current
  symptoms
- Stress reduction techniques: Relaxation and mindfulness exercises can help manage stress, which can worsen symptoms.
- Maintain regular contact with key supportive relationships through structured activities that minimize sensory and emotional overload

## Daily Living and Functional Support

- Structured psychoeducation about functional neurological disorders to enhance understanding and reduce symptom-focused anxiety
- Wellness activities: Engaging in activities that promote self-care, such as meditation, yoga, or art therapy, can help Max manage stress and find moments of peace.
- Consider a structured part-time academic schedule to reduce cognitive overload while maintaining engagement with educational pursuits
- Environmental modifications to accommodate processing speed limitations: extended time for tasks, reduced multitasking demands, and minimized time pressure

The key is for Max not to try to navigate this alone. Seeking out professional support and connecting with a community of understanding individuals can be invaluable as he works through the emotional and psychological challenges he's facing.
