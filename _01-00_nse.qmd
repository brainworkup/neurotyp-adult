The following information was obtained during an interview with {{< var patient >}} and from review of available medical records. {{< var first_name >}} has been doing well in {{< var his_her >}} classes since starting law school and has never failed. However, issues have begun to arise that {{< var he_she >}} has been unable to avoid, including being easily distracted, restlessness, constantly fidgeting, procrastination, and variable attention. {{< var he_she_cap >}} suspects having ADHD and has always struggled with aspects of it. {{< var first_name >}}'s mother tried to get {{< var his_her >}} evaluated and tested when {{< var he_she >}} was younger, but was never able to do so because {{< var his_her >}} school at the time did not agree that there were major concerns. {{< var he_she_cap >}} has noticed increasing difficulty initiating tasks, especially when it comes to writing long research papers, and has been procrastinating more and more. {{< var first_name >}} has read up on ADHD and believes {{< var he_she >}} may have it, but has been able to hide it from others, as {{< var he_she >}} has "gotten good at pretending to pay attention." {{< var he_she_cap >}} seeks further assessment and evaluation to identify any underlying neurocognitive factors influencing {{< var his_her >}} academic motivations and performance.

**Cognitive complaints**: sustained attention, working memory, and organization.
