There are several support systems and community resources that could be helpful for Mr. Smalls as he copes with the emotional and psychological impact of the accident:

1. Grief counseling or support groups: Reaching out to grief counselors or joining a support group for individuals who have experienced traumatic loss could provide a safe space for Mr. Smalls to process his feelings of guilt, shame, and grief.

2. Trauma-informed therapy: Finding a therapist who specializes in trauma-informed care can help Mr. Smalls work through the PTSD-like symptoms he may be experiencing, such as flashbacks, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping.

3. Religious or spiritual community: Connecting with his Jewish community, whether through a synagogue or other religious organizations, can provide Mr. Smalls with a sense of belonging and support during this difficult time.

4. Victim support services: There may be local organizations or programs that offer resources and assistance to victims of accidents and their families. Mr. Smalls's attorney or local authorities may be able to connect him with these services.

5. Peer support groups: Joining a support group specifically for individuals who have been involved in accidental deaths or serious injuries could help Mr. Smalls feel less alone and provide a space to share his experiences.

6. Wellness activities: Engaging in activities that promote self-care, such as meditation, yoga, or art therapy, can help Mr. Smalls manage stress and find moments of peace.

The key is for Mr. Smalls not to try to navigate this alone. Seeking out professional support and connecting with a community of understanding individuals can be invaluable as he works through the emotional and psychological challenges he's facing.
