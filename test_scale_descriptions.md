# NEPSY-2 Data Dictionary

## Memory

- List Memory Interference Effect (difference between correct words Trial 5 minus correct words Trial 7) – a high interference percentile indicates that presentation of new, similar information reduces recall of previously learned information. A low interference percentile indicates that the presentation of new, similar information does not reduce recall of previously learned information.

- List Memory Delayed Effect (difference between correct words Trial 5 minus correct words Delayed Recall) – a large negative delay effect represents a high rate of forgetting; the child loses more information over time than expected. A large positive delay effect suggests that the child’s memory improves as information is given time to consolidate).

# Child Executive Battery

**Strengths (High Average Scores):**

1. **Maintenance and Resequencing of Number and Letter Strings in Working Memory:** Biggie demonstrates high average ability in tasks requiring the retention and manipulation of information, which is beneficial for complex problem-solving and following multi-step directions.

**Adequate Skills (Average Scores):**

1. **Strategic Planning and Organization:** Biggie is capable of formulating an action plan, suggesting adequate executive functioning for age-related tasks.
2. **Auditory Attentional Capacity and Sequential Recall:** Biggie can process auditory information effectively, which is necessary for listening to and remembering instructions or oral presentations.
3. **Response Monitoring and Working Memory for Auditory Information:** These skills are average, indicating Biggie can monitor {{< var his_her >}} own responses and manipulate auditory information to a typical degree.
4. **Visual-Motor Processing and Perceptual Speed:** These average scores imply Biggie can perform tasks involving visual perception and motor coordination at a typical rate.
5. **Selective Attention Task Performance:** Biggie’s ability to focus on specific stimuli while ignoring distractions is typical for {{< var his_her >}} age group.
6. **Reasoning for Problem-Solving:** {{< var his_her_cap >}} capacity to reason and solve problems quickly is also at an expected level.

**Weaknesses (Low Average to Below Average Scores):**

1. **Working Memory with Auditory Attention and Mental Manipulation:** Falling in the low average range, Biggie may struggle with tasks requiring complex mental juggling, like advanced mathematics or understanding layered concepts in reading comprehension.
2. **Efficiency of Psychomotor Speed and Visual Coordination:** Low average scores here may translate to slower completion of tasks that require visual scanning and coordination, such as copying from the board or navigating busy environments.
3. **Recall of Digits Backward:** A below-average score indicates difficulties with tasks requiring reverse sequencing, which could affect mathematical problem-solving and comprehension of concepts that rely on understanding sequences in reverse.

**Significant Concerns (Exceptionally Low Scores):**

1. **Scanning, Visuomotor Tracking, Divided Attention, and Cognitive Flexibility:** Exceptionally low scores in these areas are indicative of significant difficulties in switching between tasks, maintaining attention on moving objects, and adapting to new information. This could manifest in challenges with reading, writing, and managing transitions between tasks or activities.
2. **Basic Psychomotor Processing Speed:** An exceptionally low score here implies a notable delay in performing simple motor tasks, which could affect a wide range of daily activities, from handwriting to engaging in sports or physical activities.

scale == "Judgment" ~ "This subtest is designed to assess an individual's judgment and decision-making capabilities in situations that are likely to occur in everyday life. Participants are asked to provide responses to a series of hypothetical situations, and their answers are assessed for appropriateness, safety, and practicality. This task taps into multiple aspects of executive functioning, including problem-solving, decision-making, logical thinking, and the application of social norms and rules.",
