<<PROMPT>>

## Area: General Cognitive Ability/Intelligence

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to the area denoted above. For scores that are Below { range } to Exceptionally Low, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are Exceptionally High/Above { range } to Exceptionally Low/Below { range } to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Finally, recommended additional support that the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall Below { range } to Exceptionally Low, or scores that are significantly discrepant and lower than expected relative to other scores (e.g., verbal reasoning versus nonverbal reasoning).

<<EXAMPLE>>

{{< var patient >}} evidenced a balanced intellectual profile with no
significant deviations from the norm relative to same-aged peers.

- **Knowledge**: { range } level of acquired knowledge and verbal skills, commensurate with {{< var his_her >}} age and educational background. {{< var his_her_cap >}} understanding of facts, vocabulary, and general knowledge is typical.

- **Reasoning**: { range } fluid/nonverbal reasoning, which indicates a typical ability to reason, problem-solve, and adapt to new situations or tasks. {{< var he_she_cap >}} can manage new challenges and abstract reasoning tasks as effectively as {{< var his_her >}} peers.

- **General Intelligence**: { range } overall cognitive functioning for daily tasks. While {{< var he_she >}} may occasionally find complex or highly demanding cognitive tasks challenging, {{< var he_she >}} generally should manage well in typical day-to-day activities.
