<<PROMPT>>

## Area: General Cognitive Ability/Intelligence

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to the area
denoted above. For scores that are Below
Average to Exceptionally Low, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily
functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that
are Exceptionally High/Above Average to Exceptionally Low/Below Average to
delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Finally, recommended
additional support that the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall
Below Average to Exceptionally Low, or scores that are significantly discrepant
and lower than expected relative to other scores (e.g., verbal reasoning versus
nonverbal reasoning).

<<EXAMPLE>>

{{< var params.patient >}} evidenced a balanced intellectual profile with no
significant deviations from the norm relative to same-aged peers.

- **Knowledge**: Average level of acquired knowledge and verbal skills, commensurate with his age and educational background. His understanding of facts, vocabulary, and general knowledge is typical.

- **Reasoning**: Average fluid/nonverbal reasoning, which indicates a typical
ability to reason, problem-solve, and adapt to new situations or tasks. He can manage new challenges and abstract reasoning tasks as
effectively as his peers.

- **General Intelligence**: Average overall cognitive functioning for daily
tasks. While he may occasionally find complex or highly demanding cognitive
tasks challenging, he generally should manage well in typical day-to-day activities.
