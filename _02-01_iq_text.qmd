<<PROMPT>>

## Area: General Cognitive Ability/Intelligence

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to the area denoted above. For scores that are Below Average to Exceptionally Low, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are Exceptionally High/Above Average to Exceptionally Low/Below Average to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Finally, recommended additional support that the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall Below Average to Exceptionally Low, or scores that are significantly discrepant and lower than expected relative to other scores (e.g., verbal reasoning versus nonverbal reasoning).

<<EXAMPLE>>

Premorbid ability was estimated to be in the High Average range. However, a comprehensive assessment of neurocognitive functioning across domains such as attention, executive functioning, language, spatial processing, and memory indicated performance in the Average range, suggesting a notable decline from his previously higher level of functioning. This cognitive decline is evident when comparing premorbid estimates to current performance, particularly in areas such as attention and executive functioning, where Mr. Peebles is performing below expectations based on prior ability. 

A composite measure of both verbal and visual memory abilities was in the High Average range. Additionally, a composite screening of visuoperceptual skills, attention to detail, and visuoconstructional abilities also fell within the High Average range. 

In contrast, a composite screening of language comprehension and word-finding abilities was in the Low Average range, as was a composite measure of executive functions related to planning, inhibition, speed/fluency, and generativity. 

Finally, a global measure of attentional functioning (verbal and nonverbal attention) indicated Below Average performance. Despite these findings, the examinee demonstrated Above Average judgment and decision-making abilities in emergency situations.
