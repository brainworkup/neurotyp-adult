INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Upload and use the "neurocog.csv" or "neurobehav.csv" file and any of the following csv files:

- iq.csv
- academics.csv
- verbal.csv
- spatial.csv
- memory.csv
- executive.csv
- adhd.csv
- social.csv
- emotion.csv
- adaptive.csv
- g.csv

2. Summarize and interpret this overall neuropsychological profile and individual test scores related to the area denoted below.

3. Interpret individual test scores under the "scale" column/variable; use these additional variables: "test_name", "scale", "score", "percentile", "ci_95" (if available), and "result" in your interpretation.

4. Compute means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals (remove missing/NA data) across these variables: "domain", "subdomain", "narrow domain".

5. Scores and/or domains/subdomains in the Below Average range (scores range between the 2nd and 8th percentiles) or Exceptionally Low range (scores are at the 1st percentile or lower) range are considered areas of "relative weakness"; as such, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning, such as at home, school, work, or socially. If no scores are in this range, you can ignore this step.

6. Finally, recommended additional support the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall Below Average to Exceptionally Low. If no scores are in this range, you can ignore this step.

Note: example summary text for report is provided below for each area/section

<<EXAMPLE>>

All scores in this area were { range }.
Fine motor speed and dexterity were { range } bilaterally.
No evidence of atypical lateralization of fine nor gross motor skills.
No evidence of dyspraxia.
Graphomotor speed and accuracy (i.e., graphomotor control) was intact.
Gross motor functioning including balance and gait appeared intact on observation.

## Area: Social Cognition and Social-Emotional Functioning (including autism spectrum disorder (ASD))

<<EXAMPLE>>

Emotional intelligence and social cognition were examined through a combination of performance-based tests and semi-structured clinical interviews. Performance-based testing on measures to gauge aspects of social-emotional processing and social aptitude, which are important aspects of how individuals process social information about other adults, groups, and social contexts, was intact. Global social perception fell in the { range } range, but {{< var his_her >}} overall score was significantly lower than predicted by {{< var his_her >}} General Ability Index. {{< var his_her_cap >}} ability to recognize and interpret the emotional state (happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprised, disgusted, and neutral) from a series of adult faces was average. Notably, {{< var he_she >}} performed a subset of these tasks better with multisensory input (e.g., both seeing and hearing the material).^[For example, {{< var he_she >}} had to first listen to an affectively laden audio recording and match the emotion of the speaker with the same emotion from several faces (including complex emotions such as sarcasm and confusion). Then {{< var he_she >}} had to listen to an additional set of statements and, using the prosody from the voice, match the implied tone of the speaker to one of various two-person interactions utilizing facial expressions and body language. If there was a mismatch between the speaker’s tone and the actual content of the statement that was spoken (e.g., when the speaker was being sarcastic), {{< var he_she >}} had to describe what the speaker actually meant.] {{< var patient >}} obtained { range } to Above-{ range } scores on these multisensory tasks requiring problem-solving skills in addition to basic social-emotional perception. Further, {{< var he_she >}} provided exceptionally precise verbal responses on these tasks, relying on cognition, not intuition.


## Area: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Executive Functioning (rating scales)

<<EXAMPLE>>

The observer ratings provided by {{< var observer >}} revealed significant elevations in
{{< var patient >}}'s ADHD symptomatology and executive functioning across several
domains, which collectively indicate a substantial deviation from typical adult functioning.

### ADHD Symptomatology

- **Inattention/Memory:** Pronounced challenges related to concentration and task completion.
- **Hyperactivity/Restlessness:** Marked physical restlessness, which affects {{< var his_her >}} ability to maintain composure in sedentary situations.
- **Impulsivity/Emotional Lability:** Tendencies toward impulsivity are evident, suggesting difficulties in emotional regulation and response inhibition.
- **DSM-5 Alignment:** The DSM-5 subscale scores point to mild-to-moderate difficulties specifically in the realms of Inattentiveness and Hyperactive-Impulsive Symptoms. These findings correlate with established psychosocial patterns in {{< var patient >}}'s history.
- **Adult ADHD Index Correlation:** {{< var patient >}}'s diagnostic profile exceeds the threshold typically associated with
individuals who have been diagnosed with ADHD on the composite Adult ADHD
Index.

### Executive Functioning Deficiencies

Comprehensive analysis further revealed weaknesses in everyday executive functioning. Notable areas of concern included:

"""
These are just example subdomains with the executive function area. Scales that should go into this list are those falling within the Below Average to Exceptionally Low ranges.
"""

- **Planning:** Challenges with formulating and executing strategies for task accomplishment.
- **Self-Monitoring:** A deficit in the ability to introspectively evaluate one's conduct and performance.
- **Attention:** Difficulties in sustaining focus and resisting extraneous stimuli.
- **Inhibitory Control:** Insufficient capacity to modulate behaviors or impulses that are counterproductive.
- **Organization:** An inability to effectively manage personal belongings and space.
- **Emotion Regulation:** Limited proficiency in moderating emotions and adapting to situational demands.

## Area: Personality/Behavior, Psychopathology, and Personality Assessments

<<EXAMPLE>>

{{< var patient >}} completed an objective, self-report inventory of personality and emotional functioning. Given their scores on the validity scales, there are no problems with interpreting the clinical profile. {{< var he_she_cap >}} responded in an open and forthright manner, indicating only modestly elevated levels of stress and anxiety. They seem to have a positive self-image and are likely viewed by others as warm and friendly. There do not appear to be any contributing emotional factors that would account for their current cognitive difficulties.

On the clinical scales, {{< var patient >}}'s profile revealed no elevations above the clinical skyline that would indicate the presence of clinical psychopathology in the areas that are tapped by the individual clinical scales. Based on interpretation of {{< var patient >}}'s scores, {{< var he_she >}} reported some preoccupation with physical symptoms and bodily complaints (_elevated SOM-H_); it is possible that {{< var he_she >}} may express {{< var his_her >}} psychological distress through somatic symptoms. {{< var patient >}} reported high perceived stress, a great deal of tension, and having difficulty relaxing (_elevated ANX-A_). {{< var he_she_cap >}} appears to have a tendency to be impulsive and {{< var his_her >}} impulsive behaviors may interfere with interpersonal problems and school functioning (_elevated BOR-S_). As a result of {{< var his_her >}} desire for excitement and stimulation, {{< var patient >}} may often become easily bored by routine activities (_elevated ANT-S_). Furthermore, {{< var patient >}}'s profile suggests {{< var he_she >}} tends to be egocentric and have little regard for others. Although {{< var he_she >}} may feel guilt over past misbehaviors, {{< var he_she >}} may feel little long-standing remorse (_elevated ANT-E_). On the NON scales, {{< var patient >}}'s score suggests {{< var he_she >}} generally feels {{< var his_her >}} family is a source of social support. However, {{< var he_she >}} may have few close interpersonal relationships. Finally, {{< var patient >}}'s RXR score suggests {{< var he_she >}} acknowledges the need to make changes and reports having a generally positive attitude towards making personal change. Given the patient's diagnosis of ADHD and Mood Disorder, the patient's personality profile appears to explain some of {{< var his_her >}} classic symptoms such as concentration difficulties, stimulus seeking, irritability, and impulsive behavior.

## Area: Adaptive Functioning

<<EXAMPLE>>

Adaptive functioning is a broad term that refers to the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that enable individuals to function independently and meet the demands of everyday life. These skills include things like communication, self-care, home living, social skills, and community use.

{{< var patient >}}'s adaptive functioning in everyday situations was examined. Their current overall level of adaptive behavior is in the { range }, as high as or higher than 4% of children of the same age. Adaptive skill areas within the Conceptual domain were in the { range }, with below average to impaired scores in communication (including speech, listening, conversation, and nonverbal communication skills), functional academics (performing basic pre-academic skills that form the foundations of higher-level reading, writing, and mathematics), and self-direction (ability to make independent choices, exhibit self-control, and take responsibility when appropriate). {{< var patient >}}'s specific skill sets within the Social domain were rated as being an area of concern as well. For example, they do not witness {{< var patient >}} use free time during the school day productively or interactively very often, nor engage in play and recreational activities for fun. They are also concerned about {{< var patient >}}'s ability to interact socially, initiate and maintain friendships, and express and recognize emotions. Lastly, {{< var patient >}}'s level of functioning in a classroom setting, including maintenance of school property and taking care of personal possessions was also rated an area of difficulty for them.
