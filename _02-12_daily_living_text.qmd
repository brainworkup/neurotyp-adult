The patient maintains adequate functioning in basic daily tasks such as bill payment, navigation, and emergency decision-making, but shows significant challenges in activities requiring sustained attention or reliable memory retrieval. While they can learn and process new information in the moment, their difficulty retaining this information over time combined with notably poor sustained attention (particularly evident in driving-related tasks) suggests a need for compensatory strategies in daily life. These challenges indicate the patient would benefit from external memory aids (such as reminder systems and written logs), structured routines, and careful consideration of activities that require sustained attention or quick reactions, particularly those involving safety considerations like driving.
