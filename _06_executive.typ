Formal testing of an array of attention and executive functions revealed heterogeneous skills. A composite index of both basic and complex verbal and nonverbal attentional capacity/functioning was Average. A composite index of higher executive skills was Average. Orientation to person, place, time, and situation was intact. No gross behavioral apathy or disinhibition observed. Auditory attentional capacity was Average (\# digits forward). Working memory for orally presented information was Average (\# digits backward).

Attention and executive functions underlie most, if not all, domains of cognitive performance. These are behaviors and skills that allow individuals to successfully carry-out instrumental and social activities, academic work, engage with others effectively, problem solve, and successfully interact with the environment to get needs met.
