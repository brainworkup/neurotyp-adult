## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are performance-based, and cognitive performance is summarized above. Cultural considerations were made in selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations. Test scores are reported in comparison to same-age and sex/gender peers, with labels (e.g., Below Average, Average, Above Average; [@guilmetteAmericanAcademyClinical2020]), intended to be descriptive, not diagnostic. Standardized scores provide important context, but do not alone lead to accurate diagnosis or treatment recommendations.

## Conversion of Test Scores

#set text(10pt)
#let three-line-table = tablem.with(
  render: (columns: auto, ..args) => {
    table(
      columns: (auto, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr),
      align: (col, row) =>
            if row == 0 { center + horizon }
            else if col == 0 { left + horizon }
            else { center + horizon },
      table.hline(y: 0),
      table.hline(y: 1),
      ..args,
      table.hline(),
    )
