<<PROMPT>>

## Area: Memory

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to the area denoted above. For scores that are Below { range } to Exceptionally Low, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are Exceptionally High/Above { range } to Exceptionally Low/Below { range } to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Finally, recommended additional support that the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall Below { range } to Exceptionally Low, or scores that are significantly discrepant and lower than expected relative to other scores (e.g., verbal reasoning versus nonverbal reasoning).

<<EXAMPLE>>

{{< var patient >}} demonstrated a range of performance across different memory tasks.

### Learning vs. Recall

- **Learning Efficiency**: { range } performance in learning and immediate recognition of visual material (abstract shapes). { range } performance in complex one-trial verbal learning (story learning).

- **Delayed Recall**: { range } performance in recalling verbal lists after a delay with cues and in recognizing visual material after a delay. Notable weaknesses in the delayed recall of complex verbal and visual material.

### Verbal Memory

- **Rote Memory (List Learning)**: { range } abilities in both learning and recalling lists of information after short and long delays, suggesting adequate rote memory skills.

- **Contextual Memory (Story Memory)**: { range } abilities in learning and recalling story details immediately. Continued low average abilities in recalling story details over time, indicating difficulties with contextual memory.

### Visual Memory

- **Figure Recall**: { range } performance in spontaneously recalling and reproducing a complex abstract figure after a long-term delay, suggesting difficulties with visual memory retention secondary to deficits in the initial planning and organization of the material.

- **Immediate Recognition**: { range } capabilities in learning and recognizing abstract shapes immediately.

- **Delayed Recognition**: { range } abilities in recognizing target visual material among distractors after a delay.
