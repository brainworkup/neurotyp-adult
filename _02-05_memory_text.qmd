The patient demonstrated below-average performance across various memory tasks, indicating challenges with:

- Retaining information over time
- Distinguishing between target and non-target material

### Verbal Recall
- Overall recall of verbal material: Within average ranges for some trials
- Long-term retention: Consistently low average or below average

### Recognition Tasks
- Struggled in distinguishing between target and non-target words
- Indicates challenges with accurate retrieval of specific memories when competing distractors are present

### Potential Impact on Daily Functioning
- Difficulty holding onto newly learned information
- Challenges maintaining information after a delay period
- Impaired ability to:
  - Learn new skills
  - Remember important details
  - Recall personal experiences effectively
  - Distinguish between true and false information


<!-- The patient demonstrated below-average performance across various memory tasks. These findings indicate challenges with retaining information over time and distinguishing between target and non-target material.

While overall recall of verbal material remained within average ranges for some trials, long-term retention was consistently low average or below average. This suggests difficulty with holding onto newly learned information and maintaining it after a delay period, which could impact daily functioning where remembering details quickly is crucial.

Additionally, the patient struggled in distinguishing between target and non-target words during recognition tasks, indicating challenges with accurate retrieval of specific memories from memory banks when competing distractors are present, which might affect their ability to accurately remember past events or distinguish between true versus false information they've learned.

These results highlight potential impairments in both encoding new information into memory systems and retrieving that information later on. These difficulties could potentially interfere with real-world tasks such as learning new skills, remembering important details, or even recalling personal experiences effectively. -->
