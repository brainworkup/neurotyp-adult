The patient demonstrated high-average performance on constructing and recreating abstract visual designs (tangrams), suggesting efficient use of visuo-spatial skills for mental manipulation of flat polygons and accurate stimulus reproduction. In another perceptual processing task requiring close attention to visual detail for pattern matching and image discrimination, the patient's scores fell within average ranges, indicating generally intact complex visual information processing. However, he might face challenges under time pressure or with increased visual complexity. Overall, the patient's spatial cognitive abilities are characterized as high-average in visuo-spatial reasoning capacity and average in detailed visual processing.
