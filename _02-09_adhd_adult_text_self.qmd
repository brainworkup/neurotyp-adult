<<PROMPT>>

## Area: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and executive functioning

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to the area denoted above. For scores that are Below { range }, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are Exceptionally High/Above { range } to Exceptionally Low/Below { range } to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Finally, recommended additional support that the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall Below { range } to Exceptionally Low.

Prefix the output/results as follows: Headers (e.g., Relative Strengths,
Relative Weaknesses) should be padded with ###, and output that contains lists should be
unordered and padded with - instead of ordered.

- On the CAARS scales, higher scores reflect reduced functioning, but on the CEFI scales, lower scores reflect reduced functioning.
- 
- For scores that are above average or higher on the CAARS, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning.
- 
- For scores that are below average or worse on the CEFI, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning.
