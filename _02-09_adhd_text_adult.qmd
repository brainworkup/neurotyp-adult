<<PROMPT>>

## Area: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and executive functioning

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to the area denoted above. For scores that are Below Average, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are Exceptionally High/Above Average to Exceptionally Low/Below Average to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Finally, recommended additional support that the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall Below Average to Exceptionally Low.

Prefix the output/results as follows: Headers (e.g., Relative Strengths,
Relative Weaknesses) should be padded with ###, and output that contains lists should be
unordered and padded with - instead of ordered.

- On the CAARS scales, higher scores reflect reduced functioning, but on the CEFI scales, lower scores reflect reduced functioning.
- 
- For scores that are above average or higher on the CAARS, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning.
- 
- For scores that are below average or worse on the CEFI, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning.
